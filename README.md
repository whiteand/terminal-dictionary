## Terminal Dictionary(RUS-ENG, ENG-RUS)

Terminal dictionary - utility for translating words from English into Russian and from Russian to English.

## WHY?

I was reading a Go Spec and had thought: it will be nice to make a terminal dictionary because there are such words I don't know the translation for.  And I want to find out one the translation as fast as possible using the terminal.

## Installation

This project requires github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery package
You can download it via go get command:

`go get "github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery"`

After this, you should compile dict.go file:

`go build dict.go file`

You can copy this file to your %PATH% directory to make program global.
